## MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

The application engine is a highly performant and adaptable book search engine that leverages Google Books API, originally designed with a RESTful API and later refactored to employ a GraphQL API utilizing Apollo Server for increased flexibility and efficiency.

The application is on the MERN stack, which encompasses the following technologies: React for the front end, MongoDB as the database, and Node.js with Express.js for the server and API layer. This technology stack enables the development of scalable and maintainable applications, catering to evolving user demands and requirements.

The application incorporates signup and login forms to enhance user experience and facilitate personalized data management. Once authenticated, users can save and delete book searches with these changes in the back end. This functionality showcases the importance of adaptability and responsiveness in modern web development, meeting users' needs and expectations in real-time.

## Deployment

To initialize the application, execute npm init to generate the package.json file, which serves as the configuration manifest for your project [1].

The requisite npm dependencies for optimal application functionality can be found within the package.json file. To install these dependencies, use the npm install command.

For proper database configuration, create a cluster on MongoDB Atlas, which serves as the cloud-hosted database service for this application.

To initiate the server and establish a connection with the MongoDB database via Mongoose, execute the npm start command. This will enable the application to listen for incoming requests on the specified port.

Lastly, the application has been deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform that facilitates the deployment, scaling, and management of web applications.
